\section{Graphics}

To include a graphic that appears in the list of figures, use the predefined fig command:\\
% \fig{#1: filename}{#2: label}{#3: long caption}{#4: width}{#5: short caption}
\fig{images/Rosetta_Stone.jpg}{fig:rosetta}{The Rosetta Stone}{10}{Rosetta}

%\reffig{#1: label}
And then reference it as \reffig{fig:rosetta} is easy.
