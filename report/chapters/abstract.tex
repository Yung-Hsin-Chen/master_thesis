\section*{Abstract}
This study aims to enhance Optical Character Recognition (OCR) performance by integrating language models (LM) as correctors within the OCR framework. Specifically, we explore the combination of TrOCR, a state-of-the-art OCR model, with CharBERT, a BERT-based language model, to improve text recognition and correction accuracy. Our research addresses three primary questions: the impact of the composite model on OCR performance, its ability to adapt to different domains, and the benefits of incorporating common OCR errors during training. Through a comprehensive analysis, including fine-tuning, component freezing, and the integration of dropout mechanisms and tailored tensor modules, we explore the dynamics of OCR performance in various configurations. Our findings reveal that the hybrid TrOCR-CharBERT model effectively balances visual and linguistic information, enhancing performance on historical texts and reducing over-correction to maintain the authenticity of the original image texts. Additionally, by exchanging visual and linguistic information, the LM can learn from the language context provided by the recognizer, thereby reducing the need for extensive domain-specific training data for post-correction.
